# QuestObjectTracker
Tracking external Objects just with your Oculus Quest or Quest 2 and your Android Phone. There's always been the problem of tracking external/real-world-objects standalone on Oculus Quest or Quest 2. I now solved this with QuestObjectTracker.

# How it works
It's just like outside-in-tracking: Your Android Phone acts as a basestation (pretty similar to Vive Basestations) and tracks your object in the space via a aruco-code, which is attached to the tracked object. For this, the phone needs to be calibrated first, to know, where to place the object in the virtual world. This happens by putting another aruco-code beneath the point, where the Quest/Quest 2s position gets resetted.
